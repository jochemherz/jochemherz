## Hi there, I'm Jochem Herz 👋
</br>
I love bringing unique creations to life. I'm always curious about finding new ways art to code and viceversa.  </br>
Although most of my completed projects are quite simple and unremarkable, each one has taught me a ton.  </br>
I am aspiring to become useful at the highest level.  </br></br>
