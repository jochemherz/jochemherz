## Hi there, I'm Jochem Herz 👋
</br>

I love bringing unique creations to life. I'm always curious about finding new ways code translates to art and vice versa.  </br>
Although most of my completed projects are quite simple and unremarkable, each one has taught me a ton.  </br>
Aspiring to become useful at the highest level.

### About me
</br>

I'm fascinated by the world of possibilities technology offers to art, but I could only really begin learning to code by making games and small tools for others.  
Still learning - quick to pick things up and eager to solve problems.  
</br>
Open to any challenge.
